# Quick Play Football

Welcome to the demo for a new tabletop football game codename: Quick Play Football. The name will change but we needed something :-)

_Note: I updated the game to use 2 d10 dice instead of 2 d6 dice. The changes are made on the cards, the big play and penalty cards, and in the game guide._

This is fun tabletop football game that requires:

## The Basics

The game requires two main rolls for each play: the Advantage roll and the Yardage roll. 

### Advantage roll

The Advantage roll determines which team will control the play and dictate the action. The winner of the advantage roll will roll for yardage or big plays. 

### Yardage roll

The team that wins the Advantage roll will roll to see how much yardage was gained on the play or to see if a big play has happened.

### Momentum

Momentum swings happen after a team makes a big play. After a big play is made the team that has made the big play draws a Momentum card from the top of the Momentum pile. The team has an advantage on the Advantage roll that lasts for as long as the Momentum card dicates. It could last for a drive, a quarter, or even an entire half.
